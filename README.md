Design Patterns :

-Creational : offers services concerning creation of objects in class, we use creational pattern instead of new instance because there are some cases that we need to have other objects created for the final creation of our object (multiple steps) = improve readibilty and less coupling with concrete classes

*examples : Builder / Prototype  / Simple Factory / factory method / Singleton / abstract factory / object pool

-Structural : deals with the problems of compositions, how one can create an object and add it in another existing object

*examples : Adapter / Bridge / Decorator / Composite / Facade / Flyweight / Proxy

-Behavioral : pattern that describes how classes and objects should interact with themselves
